# k-means clustering

## Clustering
 
Clustering is an unsupervised learning problem where we are given a set of data points that have to be partitioned into a given number of groups or clusters.

## K - Means Clustering

K - means clustering aims to partition a set of N vectors/obserations into K clusters with each observation belonging to a cluster with the nearest centroid. Centroid of a cluster is the mean of all vectors/observations belonging to that cluster. Mathematically, let the given N observations be vectors (x1,x2,...xN) of dimension(features) D. Let C1, C2, C3...CK be K clusters.
